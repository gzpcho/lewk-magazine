        Mission Statement: From the beginning, our mission has been to create an organization that not only educates and informs others about what is going on in the fast-paced world of fashion, everyday lifestyle, and real-world problems. But to bring others together as a community to feel free to be themselves, imperfections and all. This magazine/organization will be a safe space for those creative minds, fashion enthusiasts, and anyone and everyone who craves that creative escape.
